🚀 Ultimate Backend Development Course
– Spring Boot Edition
Learn Spring Boot from Scratch and Level Up to a Senior Software Engineer Role
🔥 T op Highlights
This course is your complete guide to backend mastery. Designed to match real-world
engineering standards, it not only teaches backend programming—it trains you to think
like a systems designer, a scalable architect, and a performance-first engineer.
🧠 Most Advanced Concepts Y ou’ll Master:
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Scale high-read or high-
write workloads independently. A must-have in fintech and analytics-heavy
domains.
API Composition & Materialized View Pattern: Aggregate data across
microservices in milliseconds—vital for dashboards, home feeds, and listings.
SAGA Pattern:
Orchestration: Use centralized services to coordinate workflows like
booking + payment.
Choreography: Design event-driven microservices where each component
reacts to events.
Event Sourcing with Kafka: Reconstruct entire system state from immutable logs.
Used for audit compliance, data replay, and analytics.
Transactional Outbox Pattern + CDC (Debezium): Guarantee safe event
publishing from the database—used in payment, messaging, and supply-chain
systems.

Consistency Models (Eventual, Causal, Immediate): Choose the right trade-oﬀs
for high-availability systems. Understand when and why banks use strict
consistency and when social apps use eventual.
DB Internals: Learn WAL (Write-Ahead Logs), MVCC, buﬀer pool, and LSM Trees.
Used by every modern RDBMS and NoSQL engine.
GeoHashing & Location Indexes: Build Uber-like location lookups using Redis
GEO, spatial indexes, and quad tree comparisons.
Distributed Locks (Redis, DB): Learn when to use pessimistic vs optimistic locking
and how Redis helps coordinate across pods and servers.
API Gateways & Service Meshes: Secure, throttle, route, and manage API access
using Kong or Spring Gateway.
Service Discovery: Learn Eureka, Consul, and dynamic resolution in scalable
service meshes.
Database Replication & Sharding: Implement master-slave, multi-master, and
leaderless replication. Learn partition strategies for scale.
